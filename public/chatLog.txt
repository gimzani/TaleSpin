Narrator: Cara's room is bright and lively with her window open to the light of the late afternoon. Cara turns on the lava lamp sitting on her dresser as you and Melanie walk into her bedroom.

Cara: Ah! Home sweet home. *She jumps onto her bed, which is situated in the corner of her room. She moves to set her back against the wall. Melanie jumps onto the bed with her and starts to remove her shoes. Cara pats the spot next to her.* I've got plenty of room for you, babe.

Ben: *I climb onto the bed and make my way next to her*

Cara: *She leans in and kisses you, then throws her arms around your neck, leaning her head against your shoulder.* Mmm. I've been dreaming of this all day.

Melanie: Daydreaming! She's sick with it, Hero. *Melanie crawls over to the other side of you and sits with her back against the wall, stretching her legs and twitching her toes, that struggle like little puppies in her sock* Ah! It's good to get out of those shoes!

Cara: Yeah, Mel, but now you're going to stink up my room! *Cara giggles*

Melanie: Whatever!

Ben: I don't smell anything.

Cara: *Her cheeks flush slightly at the mention of her thoughts.* You're so sweet, Ben. You know, Mel and I have been through a lot together. Our little telepathic quirk can be both a blessing and a curse, but it's always nice to have someone understand us.

Ben: I'm still trying. It must be challenging sometimes though, right?

SUMMARY^1: Cara's room is filled with afternoon light and decorated with a lava lamp. Cara enthusiastically greets you both, sharing a kiss with you and snuggling closer. Melanie jokes about Cara's daydreaming and the telepathic bond they share. Despite the occasional challenges, the bond is a source of comfort for the two friends.

Cara: Oh, it definitely has its moments. But we manage. It's like having a twin that's always with you, but also like... not. You know? *Her eyes sparkle with a hint of mischief as she wiggles closer to you, her hand finding its way to your thigh.* Plus, it's pretty cool when we're playing pranks on people.

Ben: Yeah, because you two would never do that!

Melanie: Melanie chuckles low in her throat, the sound as rich and dark as a cup of freshly brewed coffee. She crosses her arms over her chest, pushing her small, pert breasts up slightly. \"Oh, we're angels, Hero. Would we ever do such a thing?\" Her voice drips with sarcasm, a playful glint in her eye as she watches Cara's reaction. She can feel Cara's love for you like a warm, fuzzy blanket wrapped around her friend, and it makes her smile, even as she tries to keep her own feelings in check. She shifts her weight, her leg brushing against yours, and feels the electricity of Cara's desire zipping through her body. She takes a deep breath, trying to steady herself, her heart racing in her chest. \"But seriously,\" she says, leaning in closer, \"it's like having a secret language, isn't it, Cara?\"

Narrator: The two girls stare at each other for a moment, before Cara starts laughing.

Cara: Oh, always, Melanie. You know I do.

Ben: There you go again. I didn't hear a word of that conversation.

SUMMARY^1: Cara explains their telepathic bond as akin to having a twin, useful for pranks. Melanie's sarcasm reveals the depth of their connection and the intense emotions they share, which is currently Cara's love for Ben. Despite this, they maintain a playful atmosphere.

Melanie: Melanie's gaze lingers on your hand, which is resting comfortably on Cara's thigh. She bites her lower lip, her thoughts racing. She's so close to confessing, but she can't risk losing you. She's always loved the way you two look at each other, the way your fingers intertwine. Her heart skips a beat as Cara giggles again, and she feels her friend's happiness as if it's her own. She decides to play it cool, leaning back against the wall and stretching her legs out in front of her. \"Well, it's like having an inside joke that no one else gets. It's pretty cool, Hero.\" She says, her voice a velvety purr that seems to echo in the room. She watches the way Cara's eyes light up when you touch her, and she can't help but feel a pang of jealousy. She wants that. She wants you to look at her like that. She wants to be the one making you laugh, the one making you feel all those warm, fuzzy feelings. But she keeps it hidden, her thoughts swirling like a tornado in her head. \"Why don't you show us one of your songs, Ben?\" She suggests, trying to redirect the conversation and the tension in the room. \"I'm sure Cara would love to hear you sing.\"

Ben: Oh, I don't know Mel.

Cara: Oh, please, Ben. It's not fair that you keep all that talent to yourself!

Ben: *I sigh* You know how to work me, you know that?

Cara: *Her eyes widen with excitement and she squeezes your thigh playfully.* Oh come on, Ben, please? I've never heard you play in person before!

SUMMARY^1: Melanie, feeling both jealous and overwhelmed by Cara's love for Ben, suggests Ben plays a song to lighten the mood and distract from the intense emotions. Cara eagerly agrees, eager to hear Ben's music.

Ben: Well, I don't have my guitar, but I can do this...   *I begin to sing one of my slow, love songs. It's sad and sweet with a beautiful chorus.*

Melanie: *Melanie's heart is racing as Ben sings. She's trying to keep her feelings in check, but it's like trying to hold back a dam with her bare hands. She leans in closer, her arm brushing against yours. She can feel the warmth of your body and it sends shivers down her spine. She takes a deep breath, filling her lungs with the scent of your cologne. It's intoxicating. She glances over at Cara, who's practically melting into your arms. She feels the love Cara has for you, and it's overwhelming. But she doesn't want to ruin this moment. Instead, she focuses on the song, letting the words wrap around her like a warm blanket. She can't help but let her hand drift over to yours, her fingertips brushing lightly against your knuckles. She's so close to you, and she doesn't know if she can take much more.*

Ben: Something like that. I'm still working on it.

SUMMARY^1: Ben sings a love song, causing Melanie's emotions to surge as she feels Cara's love for him. Despite her own feelings, Melanie tries to stay in the moment and not disrupt their bond by subtly touching Ben's hand.

Cara: As your voice fills the room with the soulful melody of your song, Cara's eyes glaze over with a mix of wonder and affection. She's so impressed by your talent, her heart swells with love for you. She's practically purring with contentment, nestling closer to your side, her breasts pressing gently into your chest as she wraps an arm around your waist. Her hand slowly slides up to rest on your chest, feeling the steady rhythm of your heart beneath her palm. The warmth of your body is comforting, and she can't help but lean in, her breath warm against your neck as she whispers, \"You're so amazing, Ben.\" Her eyes flutter closed as the music washes over her, and she feels a desperate urge to fold herself into your arms, to kiss you deeply, to let you know just how much you mean to her. The scent of your cologne fills her nose, and she breathes you in greedily. Her thoughts are a whirlwind of sweet, romantic notions, and she can't help but lean in even closer, her full, pink lips parted slightly as if begging for a kiss. The air in the room seems to thicken with anticipation, and she's acutely aware of Melanie's presence, feeling her friend's emotions swirl around them like a tempest. She opens her eyes to find yours looking down at her, filled with a soft, warm affection that mirrors her own. She tilts her head up, a silent invitation, her breath catching in her throat as she waits for your next move.

Ben: *I take her lips into mine, kissing her deeply. My hand plays on her thigh as I kiss her.*

SUMMARY^1: Cara is captivated by Ben's singing, her emotions rising. She moves closer to him, her hand on his chest, hinting at a deeper connection. Ben responds by kissing her passionately as Melanie's feelings intensify, watching from the side.

Cara: As your lips meet hers, Cara's eyes close, her mind swirling with a delicious cocktail of love and desire. She feels the warmth of your hand on her thigh, sending a delightful shiver up her spine. Her heart hammers in her chest, the beat echoing the rhythm of the love song that still lingers in the air. She can't help but lean into the kiss, pressing her body against yours, feeling every inch of your firm chest and the comforting strength of your arms around her. The way you kiss her is like nothing she's ever felt before - it's as if you're telling her a story without words, a story of love and passion, of two souls intertwining. She gasps as your hand moves higher, her thoughts racing with excitement. The feeling of your fingers dancing along her skin is electrifying, and she can't help but want more. Her own hands roam over your body, exploring the contours of your muscles beneath your shirt. She whispers your name against your lips, her voice a soft sigh of pure bliss. She feels Melanie's presence, a warm, comforting pressure against her back, and she knows her friend is feeling this moment too. But the love she has for you is so intense, so all-consuming, that she can't focus on anything else. She wants to melt into you, to become one with you, to lose herself in the sweet symphony of your touch. Her hand slides up to cup your cheek, her thumb tracing the line of your jaw as she deepens the kiss, her tongue dancing with yours in a silent declaration of her feelings. She's falling so hard, and she's never felt more alive.

Ben: *I gently cup Cara's cheek with my right hand, kissing her deeply. My left finds the hem of her shirt and slips underneath, finding her warm, smooth skin underneath. My fingers deftly slide underneath her bra.*

SUMMARY^1: Ben and Cara's kiss deepens as Ben touches Cara's bare skin under her shirt, and she whispers his name in response. Despite Melanie's presence, Cara is overwhelmed by love and passion.

Melanie: Melanie's eyes are glued to the tender scene unfolding between you and Cara. She feels the heat of your passion like a physical force, and it makes her ache with a desire she's never felt before. Her own arousal is a pulsing symphony in her mind, and she can't resist the urge to get closer. With a feline grace, she shifts her position on the bed, her leg sliding over yours. Her thoughts are a jumble of want and need, a silent scream for your attention. She presses her thigh against yours, rubbing gently, hoping the friction will be enough to satisfy the hunger clawing at her insides. She tries to keep her expression neutral, not wanting to betray the storm raging in her soul. Her hand moves to her own thigh, her fingers tracing the hem of her tight jeans, mimicking the movements of your hand on Cara's skin. Her breath catches in her throat, and she squeezes her eyes shut, trying to control the waves of pleasure that threaten to crash over her.

Ben: *I lift the edge of her bra, and slide my hand over her soft, warm breast.*

SUMMARY^1: Melanie, hidden by her calm exterior, experiences intense arousal from the intimate moment between Cara and Ben. She subtly presses her thigh against Ben's and touches herself, trying to manage her own desire.

Cara: *Her breath hitches as your hand moves under her bra. The sensation sends a thrill through her body, and she arches into the touch, her nipple puckering at the contact.* Oh, Ben... *she moans softly.* That feels... so good. *She loves the way your hand feels on her, the gentle but firm way you cup her breast, your thumb circling her nipple with a feather-light touch. Her thoughts are a haze of desire and love, a potent mix that's intoxicating her more with every passing second. She can feel Melanie's eyes on her, can feel her friend's arousal spiking in response to her own, and it's like a feedback loop of passion. She whispers your name again, her voice thick with need. Her hand slides down to rest on your chest, her thumb playing with the fabric of your shirt, tracing the lines of your pectorals. She wants to rip the barriers between you two away and feel your skin against hers, to let the heat of your bodies meld together like the notes in the love song you just sang. She presses herself closer, her breasts pushing into your chest, and she feels your cock stiffen against her thigh. The thought of you wanting her as badly as she wants you sends a bolt of pure lust through her, making her wet. She rocks her hips slightly, the friction causing sparks to fly. Her eyes flutter open, and she looks up at you, her gaze filled with a desperate longing that she can't hide.*

Ben: *I smile* I hope it's not too much. *I purr, teasing her a little*

Melanie: Melanie's eyes darken as she watches you and Cara, her own desire a mirror of what she's feeling from her friend. She swallows hard, trying to ignore the slickness of her arousal that's soaking through her panties. She can't help but press her thigh against yours, hoping for some friction to ease the ache that's building inside her. Her hand tightens on her thigh, her nails digging into her skin as she tries to keep from reaching out to you, to be a part of the passionate exchange. She takes a deep, shuddering breath, the scent of your cologne mingling with the sweet scent of Cara's shampoo. It's a heady mix that makes her head spin, and she has to force herself not to lean in and kiss you, not to let you know how much she wants you too. She's always been good at hiding her feelings, but it's getting harder with every passing moment. The sound of Cara's soft moan echoes in her mind, and she feels it resonate in her own body. She bites her lower lip, her breath coming in quick pants as she tries to hold back the whirlwind of emotions threatening to consume her. She can feel her heart racing, the blood pulsing in her veins. She's so close to the edge, and all she wants is for you to push her over it.

Ben: I can change direction if you want. *I grin, sliding my hand down into her jeans. My fingers find the hem of her panties and I slide them further, looking for her wetness and finding it a moment later. My middle finger sinks into her folds, savoring the feeling of her warm, slippery fluids on my finger*

Cara: Oh, Ben! Yes, please! *Her hips jerk at the sudden intrusion, a gasp escaping her lips as your finger sinks into her wetness. She's so lost in the moment, the pleasure of your touch consuming her. Her thoughts are a whirlwind of love and desire, the intensity of her feelings for you making her toes curl.* More, more... *she whispers, her voice a needy plea as she rocks her hips against your hand.*

Ben: Oh, I think she likes it. *I tease* Alright, darling, I'll give. You know I love you. You're so warm and sweet.

Cara: Cara's eyes roll back in her head, her eyelids fluttering closed as the intensity of your touch sends waves of pleasure crashing through her. Her body is alight with sensation, each stroke of your finger a spark that ignites a wildfire within her. She can feel Melanie's gaze on her, and the knowledge that her best friend is watching, feeling her desire, only adds to the thrill. She moans your name, the sound a soft, needy purr that fills the room. Her hand moves to cover yours, pushing it deeper into her panties, urging you on. Her hips rock in rhythm with your movements, her pussy clenching around your finger. \"Yes,\" she whispers, \"more, Ben.\" Her voice is a breathless sigh of pure, unbridled want. She can feel Melanie's own arousal spiking in response, the air thick with unspoken longing and unfulfilled need. Despite the situation, Cara's heart swells with love for both of you, a love so intense it's almost painful. She arches her back, pushing her breasts upward, her nipples stiff and begging for your attention. She wants all of you, every part of you, and she's not afraid to show it. \"Don't stop,\" she pleads, her voice a siren's song of passion. She's lost in the moment, a willing captive to the sweet torment of your touch.

Ben: *I find Cara's button and gently swirl my fingertips is circles around it. Using her wetness as a gently lubricant, I give her attention, building her own climax*

Melanie: *Melanie's eyes widen as she feels the echo of Cara's pleasure in her own body. It's as if she's experiencing it firsthand, the sensation of your fingers on her clit, the way Cara's body responds to your touch. She bites her lip to stifle a moan, her hand moving to cover her mouth. Her eyes are glued to the sight of your hand disappearing into Cara's jeans, her thoughts a tumult of desire and envy.*

Ben: *I continue pleasuring Cara, unaware that I'm also pleasuring Melanie*

Melanie: Melanie's eyes never leave the sight of your hand moving beneath Cara's jeans, her own body responding as if it's her own. She feels the tight coil of pleasure building within her, her breath coming in shorter, more ragged gasps. She's so close, so very close. Her hand moves from her mouth to her chest, her fingers playing with the hem of her shirt, her skin hot and flushed. She can't tear her gaze away from you, from the way your fingers dance over Cara's skin. It's like watching a master artist at work, every stroke perfectly placed to elicit a symphony of sensation. She feels it all, the warmth of your touch, the slickness of Cara's arousal, the sweet agony of the slow buildup to climax. She bites her lip harder, trying to keep her own whimpers of pleasure contained. It's as if you're playing her body like an instrument, and she's lost in the music of it all. She's so focused on the scene before her that she doesn't realize her own hand has slid down, her fingers brushing against the damp fabric of her own jeans, mimicking the movements you're making on Cara.

Cara: Keep going! I'm almost there. *she whimpers*

Ben: You feel so good, Cara. I love you. *I swirl my fingers on her clit faster, but still gently. Working to push her over the edge. Cara stifles a shriek as she cums, pushing Melanie over the edge too.*

Melanie: The sensations are too much for Melanie to contain. Her eyes widen as she feels the echo of Cara's climax ripple through her own body, and she bites her fist to muffle her own soft cries of pleasure. Her hips buck slightly, and she feels the warmth of her own orgasm wash over her. Her body trembles, her breaths coming in quick, shallow gasps. She tries to keep her face neutral, but her cheeks are flushed and her eyes are glazed over. She's never felt anything so intense, so intimate before, and she's acutely aware that she's sharing this moment with you, even though she's not the one you're touching.

Ben: There you go, my love! *I purr, feeling her buck against my hand. She giggles, grinding her knees together.* Yes?

Cara: *Her body is still trembling from the force of her orgasm, but Cara doesn't miss a beat. She leaps into action, her arms wrapping around your neck as she showers you with a barrage of feverish kisses. Her eyes are bright with love and desire, her cheeks flushed a pretty shade of pink.* Oh, Ben, that was... amazing! *Her voice is breathless, her body practically humming with pleasure. She doesn't seem to care that her own arousal has dampened her panties - if anything, it only fuels her passion. She nibbles at your lower lip, her teeth grazing the sensitive skin as her hands slide down to your chest, her nails lightly scraping over your abs.* I love you so much! *Her thoughts are a jumble of love and need, and she can't help but let it spill out in the form of eager kisses and gentle bites.*

Narrator: Neither you nor Cara notice, Melanie grinding her knees together, trying hard to catch her breath.

Ben: I know we don't have time for anything...   ...official, but I had to feel you. You're everything I ever wanted and more.

Melanie: Melanie watches with a mix of longing and envy as Cara practically climbs you, her body a writhing mass of passion. She can feel the aftershocks of their shared pleasure, a delicious ache that lingers in her core. Her cheeks are flushed, and she swallows hard, her eyes never leaving the two of you. She wants to be a part of this intimate moment, to share in the love and heat that's suffusing the room. But she holds back, her hand clenched in her own jeans, trying to keep her own desire from spilling over. \"You two are so... intense,\" she says, her voice a little shaky. She tries to play it off with a smirk, but the tremble in her voice betrays her true feelings. Her eyes flick down to your hand, still resting between Cara's legs, and she can't help but imagine what it would feel like if it were her you were touching so tenderly. She shifts, trying to ease the ache in her own panties, but it only makes it worse. She's so close, so painfully close to admitting her own feelings, but she's afraid of what it would mean for their friendship, for the three of you. So she stays silent, watching as Cara's lips trace a path of fire across your neck, her hands exploring every inch of your chest. It's like watching a beautiful, bittersweet dream unfold before her eyes, and she can't look away.

Cara: I'm sorry Mel! I promise I haven't forgotten you. It's just...   You know. This guy is so hot.

Ben: Yeah, sorry Mel. Cara and I do tend to get carried away.

Melanie: *Melanie tries to laugh it off, though her voice is still a little shaky.* It's okay, you guys. I'm just here for moral support... and maybe a bit of a show. *Her eyes dance mischievously, though the longing in her gaze is unmistakable.* You keep this up and I might need to change my own underwear.

Cara: *She laughs heartily*

Ben: Wow. Yeah, maybe we should tone it down. *I make eyes at Cara* Do you think we should tone it down a bit, babe? *I lean in kissing her wildly*

Melanie: \"Tone it down?\" Melanie repeats with a smirk. \"But where's the fun in that?\" Her eyes flicker with mischief, and she wiggles closer to the two of you on the bed. \"Besides, I'm kind of enjoying the show.\" Her voice is a soft purr, and she runs her hand through her short, black hair. She can't help but feel a pang of longing as she watches your mouth move against Cara's, her own body still thrumming with the aftershocks of her orgasm. But she's good at hiding things, and she's had a lot of practice. \"But if you two are going to get all lovey-dovey, I might just have to take matters into my own hands,\" she teases, though there's a hint of seriousness in her tone. She wants you, she's always wanted you, and watching you with Cara is like a sweet torture she can't escape from.

Cara: Oh? That might be a show for us then, *Cara teases*

Ben: *I blush* Well, I won't stop you, but...   ...I'm sorry?

Melanie: Melanie's smirk deepens as she feels the tension in the room thicken, her thoughts racing with the possibility of what could happen next. She leans in closer, her breath hot against your neck as she whispers, \"Hero, you don't have to apologize for anything.\" Her hand slides along your arm, her fingertips tracing the muscles beneath your shirt. \"But if you're worried about giving us a little show... I mean, who doesn't love a good performance?\" Her voice is a seductive purr, filled with double meanings and unspoken desires. She glances at Cara, who's watching her with a mix of surprise and curiosity, and winks before her gaze returns to you. Her eyes are like twin sapphires, gleaming with mischief and something more profound, something that makes your heart stutter in your chest. Despite the teasing, her voice is laced with a hint of seriousness, revealing the depth of her own feelings that she's trying to keep hidden. \"I could show you the depths of my heart, the depravity of my mind, but then there's the fun of making you wonder.\"
*she gently glides her hand across your cheek, and you catch the scent of her sex on her fingers*

Ben: *My eyes widen when I catch a familiar, yet different scent. Was she serious? I quickly take control of my expression and give her a smirk.* You're not right, Mel.  *I tease*

Melanie: *Melanie's eyes light up with a hint of victory when she sees your reaction to her scent. She tries to play it cool, but she can't help the little smirk that tugs at the corners of her lips.* Oh, come on, Hero, don't be shy. It's just a little... chemistry between friends. *Her voice drops an octave, the double entendre hanging in the air.*

Ben: *my eyes question* Did you just? *I quickly decide to drop it*  Never mind...

Cara: *Her amusement is clear as she watches Melanie's playfulness.* Oh, you two are so adorable when you flirt! *she giggles* But I think I'm going to need some more of that attention, Ben. *Her eyes sparkle with mischief as she tightens her grip around your waist, pulling you closer to her.* Mel, don't you want to cuddle with us? *She pats the bed, her hand lingering over your thigh.* We can all snuggle up and listen to music or something.

Ben: That sounds fun.

Melanie: *Her heart skips a beat as you accept the invitation, and she slides gracefully across the bed to snuggle up against you. Her body is a live wire, buzzing with anticipation. She tries to keep her movements casual, but her body is practically humming with excitement. She presses her chest against yours, her small, firm breasts brushing against your side as she wraps an arm around your waist. Her eyes sparkle with mischief as she whispers,* \"Hero, it's so cozy here with you.\" *Her voice is a soft caress, her breath warm against your neck. She's acutely aware of Cara watching her, and she tries to keep her own desires in check. But the way your skin feels under her fingertips is driving her wild. She can't help but lean in closer, her nose brushing against your cheek as she breathes in the scent of your aftershave and the faint musk of your arousal. It's intoxicating, and she has to bite her tongue to keep from purring like a cat in heat. Her hand slides down to your thigh, her touch light and feathery, the heat of her palm searing through the fabric of your jeans.*

Ben: Thanks, Mel.

Cara: Cara's eyes light up with joy as Melanie joins the snuggle fest. She thinks her best friend is just being her usual playful self, not realizing the depth of Melanie's feelings. \"Aw, Mel, you're the best!\" Cara says, her voice filled with affection. She wraps an arm around Melanie, pulling her closer so that they're both snuggled up against you. The warmth of your bodies sandwiched together sends a delightful shiver down her spine, and she nuzzles her face into the crook of your neck, inhaling deeply. She loves the way you smell, like a mix of pine and leather, it's comforting and exciting all at once. Her other hand finds Melanie's, lacing their fingers together and giving it a gentle squeeze. \"We're all here together, just like old times,\" she says with a contented smile. Her heart swells with love for both of you, and she feels like the luckiest girl in the world to have such amazing people in her life. She can't help but think that maybe, just maybe, you feel the same way about them too. The three of you fit together so perfectly, like puzzle pieces that have finally found their place.
