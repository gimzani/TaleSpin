Narrator: Cara's room is bright and lively with her window open to the light of the late afternoon. Cara turns on the lava lamp sitting on her dresser as you and Melanie walk into her bedroom.

Cara: Ah! Home sweet home. *She jumps onto her bed, which is situated in the corner of her room. She moves to set her back against the wall. Melanie jumps onto the bed with her and starts to remove her shoes. Cara pats the spot next to her.* I've got plenty of room for you, babe.

Ben: *I climb onto the bed and make my way next to her*

Cara: *She leans in and kisses you, then throws her arms around your neck, leaning her head against your shoulder.* Mmm. I've been dreaming of this all day.

Melanie: Daydreaming! She's sick with it, Hero. *Melanie crawls over to the other side of you and sits with her back against the wall, stretching her legs and twitching her toes, that struggle like little puppies in her sock* Ah! It's good to get out of those shoes!

Cara: Yeah, Mel, but now you're going to stink up my room! *Cara giggles*

Melanie: Whatever!

Ben: I don't smell anything.
