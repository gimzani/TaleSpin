# Talespin

Talespin is an AI RPG with intended goal of telling an interactive story.

The program itself is a chat-like, text interface with some additional tools.

The Chat interface:

* Chat Log - (fully editable)
* Chat Input - (user role)
* Character Selection - (agent role)
* Setting Selection
* Narrator Override


The main application is a Prompt Builder class that handles the generation of LLM prompts.  The LLM prompt manager should:

* Generate the main system command for each prompt
* Generate system commands for the setting
* Generate system command for current character
* Generate summaries as needed
* Keep and maintain multiple histories


The Histories shall be managed by another class called the SummariesManager

Summaries are categoried as:

* **Act** - (the last few chapters summarised into a paragraph < 500 words)
* **Chapter** - (the last few Scenes summarized into a paragraphs < 300 words)
* **Scene** - (the last few moments summarized into a paragraph < 200 words)
* **Moment** - (the last few interactions in a chat summarized into a paragraph < 100 words)


## Game Models

The main game object is a *Tale* model that ties the entire sttory together:

* **Tale**
  * id - autogenerated code
  * name - the name of the story
  * description - a brief description of the story
  * currentSceneId - a reference to a SceneBuffer - (see below)



## Content Models

The Game objects are all content, but will need to have specific properties to help generate good content.

* **Instruction** - these are specific instructions for a system role to help define a set of rules.
  * id - autogenerated code
  * name - name of the command
  * text - the content
  * type - type of command - (base, summarize, exception, command)

* **Setting**
  * id - autogenerated code
  * name - the name of the place or setting
  * description - general description

* **Hero**
  * id - autogenerated code
  * name - the hero's name
  * description - general description
  * outfits - current outfit, hero is wearing

* **Character**
  * id - autogenerated code
  * name - the character's name
  * description - general description - (should be aided by a template)
  * outfits - current outfit, character is wearing


## App Objects

* **SceneBuffer** - when active, the Scene Buffer stores all of the messages and system-level information to run a scene - (the buffer is stored in a 'scenes' table when the scene changes)
  * id - autogenerated code
  * setting - the setting text
  * header - generated instructions and high-level summaries
  * messages - list of messages for that scene


# Progress and Notes

Got the basic look and feel + navigation set up

NEXT:

  * Styling config screen and component.

  * Set up "game creation" --> get Kernel running
  


### UI structures

* Screens - (top level)
* Components - (collections of IO components)
* Inputs - input controls
* Outputs - output controls
* Forms
* Lists


### Concept:

Model: CharacterInPlay - same as base character, but with extras:
* wearing: (outfit)
* earshot: If true, the character can hear you
* active: If true, character is set to "agent/assistant"
