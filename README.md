# Talespin

Talespin is an AI RPG with intended goal of telling an interactive story.

The program itself is a chat-like, text interface with some additional tools.

The application should allow for the selection of a hero, multiple characters, and an initial Location for the story.

The game begins with text that sets the story. The player then plays the part of the hero and interacts with the story.

Speaking to a character will get their attention, and the player can use the controls on the screen to manually select a character to interact with. The player can also use a set of controls to determine if the character is in earshot of the conversation - (this may prevent the other character from responding to a question or mention of their name.)

At any time, the player can request a scene change, where they are presented with a dialog box asking them to describe the new scene. They may also select the charaters that are in the new scene, or create new charaters for the scene.



## Interface

The Chat interface:

* Chat Log - (fully editable)
* Chat Input - (user role)
* Character Selection - (agent role)
* Setting Selection
* Narrator Override


The main application is a Prompt Builder class that handles the generation of LLM prompts.  The LLM prompt manager should:

* Generate the main system command for each prompt
* Generate system commands for the setting
* Generate system command for current character
* Generate summaries as needed
* Keep and maintain multiple histories




## Game Models

The main game object is a *Tale* model that ties the entire sttory together:

* **Tale**
  * id - autogenerated code
  * name - the name of the story
  * description - a brief description of the story
  * currentSceneId - a reference to a SceneBuffer - (see below)



## Content Models

The Game objects are all content, but will need to have specific properties to help generate good content.

* **Instruction** - these are specific instructions for a system role to help define a set of rules.
  * id - autogenerated code
  * name - name of the command
  * text - the content
  * type - type of command - (base, summarize, exception, command)

* **Location**
  * id - autogenerated code
  * name - the name of the place or setting
  * description - general description

* **Hero**
  * id - autogenerated code
  * name - the hero's name
  * description - general description
  * outfits - current outfit, hero is wearing

* **Character**
  * id - autogenerated code
  * name - the character's name
  * description - general description - (should be aided by a template)
  * outfits - current outfit, character is wearing


## App Objects

* **SceneBuffer** - when active, the Scene Buffer stores all of the messages and system-level information to run a scene - (the buffer is stored in a 'scenes' table when the scene changes)
  * id - autogenerated code
  * setting - the setting text
  * header - generated instructions and high-level summaries
  * messages - list of messages for that scene


# Progress and Notes

Got the basic look and feel + navigation set up

NEXT:
  
  * Set up "game creation" --> get Kernel running
  
### UI structures

* Screens - (top level)
* Components - (collections of IO components)
* Inputs - input controls
* Outputs - output controls
* Forms
* Lists


### Concept:

Model: CharacterInPlay - same as base character, but with extras:
* wearing: (outfit)
* earshot: If true, the character can hear you
* active: If true, character is set to "agent/assistant"
