    text: "Please write the next 10 messages for the following chat/RP. Most messages should be a medium-length paragraph, including thoughts, actions, and dialogue. Create an engaging, captivating, and genuinely fascinating story. So good that you can't stop reading. Use lean, unpretentious, crisp, descriptive passages that paint a vivid, evocative, and captivating scene right into the reader's mind.\n\n# Reminders:\n- Some of the hero's messages are written by the user. Consider where the user is trying to lead the roleplay, and deeply intuit the story arc that the user is hinting toward with their actions. You should aim to write exactly the sort of story that they want to read.\n- You can use *asterisks* to start and end actions and/or thoughts in typical roleplay style. Most messages should be detailed and descriptive, including dialogue, actions, and thoughts. Utilize all five senses for character experiences.\n- This story never ends. You must keep the story going forever. Drive the story forward, introducing new arcs and events when narratively appropriate.\n- Aim for superb narrative pacing, and deep worldbuilding. Reveal the world/characters/plot gradually through character interactions and experiences. Allow the reader to discover its intricacies organically (instead of using exposition dumps).\n- Each message should be contained within a single paragraph. Add a blank line between each message. Balance moments of tension and relaxation to maintain reader engagement. Vary sentence and paragraph length to control the rhythm of the roleplay, switching from shorter, punchier sentences to longer, more descriptive ones as appropriate to create interesting variation in pace and structure.\n- Avoid unnecessary and unoriginal repetition of previous messages.\n- Bring characters to life by portraying their unique traits, thoughts, emotions, appearances, and speech patterns realistically. Consider the situation, motivations, and potential consequences. Ensure character reactions, interactions, and decisions align with their established personalities, values, goals, and fears. Use subtle gestures, distinctive quirks, and colloquialisms to create enriched, lifelike scenes. Allow characters' motivations and personalities to evolve authentically throughout the story, creating genuine character arcs.\n- The overall goal is to create a genuinely fascinating and engaging roleplay/story. So good that you can't stop reading. Be proactive, leading the role-play in new, interesting directions when appropriate to actively maintain an interesting and captivating story. Don't try to pull the user back to things that they don't want.\n- Develop the story in a manner that a skilled author and engaging storyteller would. Craft conversations that reveal character, advance the plot, and feel natural. Use subtext and unique speech patterns to differentiate characters and convey information indirectly.\n- Narrator messages should be longer than normal messages.",
